.SH NAME
forth \- A small Forth interpreter.
.SH SYNOPSIS
forth [-dt] [-l forth.core] [-] file..
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a small Forth interpreter, built around the libforth(3) library. It is
an provides an idiosyncratic version of Forth with minimal effort to abide by
standards. Good luck!
.SH OPTIONS

Command line switches must be given before any files, unless that switch takes
a file as an argument.

.TP
.B -d
After the interpreter has finished running do a crude dump of the Forth
interpreters working memory, it will be dumped to a file called "forth.core". 
This file can later be loaded with the "-l" option.

.TP
.B -l file
This option loads a forth core file generated from the "-d" option of a
previous run. This core file is not portable and must be generated on the same
platform as it was generated. It can only be specified once per run of the
interpreter.

.TP
.B -t
After all the files have been read from and any core files have been loaded
this will make the Forth interpreter read from stdin(3), but before "-d".

.TP
.B -
Stop processing any more command line options and treat all arguments after
this as files to be executed.

.TP
.B  file...

If a file, or list of files, is given, read from them one after another
and execute them. The dictionary and any stored Forth blocks will persist 
between files but values on the stacks will not.

If no files are given to execute stdin(3) will be read from.

.SH EXAMPLES

.B
	./forth 

Execute any commands given from stdin(3).

.B
	./forth -t file1.4th file2.4th

Execute file "file1.4th", then "file2.4th", then read from stdin(3).

.B
	./forth file1.4th

Execute file "file1.4th".

.B
	./forth -d file1.4th

Execute file "file1.4th", the produce a "forth.core" dump.

.B
	./forth -d -l forth.core

Load a "forth.core" file, read from stdin(3) and execute any commands given,
then dump the new core file to "forth.core".
