.SH NAME
FORTH \- C API for a small FORTH interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <libforth.h>
.SH DESCRIPTION
A library that implements a forth interpreter. The header "libforth.h"
documents all of the C-function calls, so to avoid duplication (and the
possibility that this is out of sync with the header) I will only document
the "main_forth()" function here.

If for some reason forth(1) has not been installed along side with this
library a simple interpreter can be built using the "main_forth()" function:

.RS
#include <libforth.h>
.P
int main(int argc, char **argv)
.P
{
.P
        return main_forth(argc,argv); 
.P
}
.RE

.SH SEE ALSO
forth(1)
.SH BUGS
It is possible to cause access invalid memory from within the FORTH virtual
machine, but only invalid FORTH programs can do this (or FORTH programs
that are too large, in keeping with FORTH philosophy these are also invalid).

Some FORTH words maybe implemented incorrectly, but given the source for
the library is less than 300 lines of C you should be able to work out
which!
