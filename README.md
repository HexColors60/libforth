INTRO
=====

This is a portable FORTH implementation called "Howe Forth", it is designed to
be customizable to your needs, modular and fairly fast. Eventually it is
intended that this will be ported to an embedded system (Most likely ARM based),
for now it will stay on the computer.

TODO:
=====

* Documentation.

* Clean up code.

* Stress testing, stress testing with Valgrind (currently gives no errors).

* File stack.

* Eval()

* Cycles.

NOTES
=====

The dictionary could be implemented with a 16-bit hash instead to save
space.
